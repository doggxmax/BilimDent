              <h2>WHAT IS DIGITAL DENTISTRY?</h2>
              <p className="digital-dentistry-description">
                Digital dentistry refers to the use of fully or partially
                computer-aided devices, methods and technology during diagnosis,
                planning and treatment. Digital dentistry methods are methods
                developed to reduce the margin of human error, increase
                production precision and shorten treatment duration. From a
                simple filling to complicated implant treatments, from aesthetic
                planning to smile design, from orthodontics to porcelain
                veneers, many applications can now be performed using digital
                technologies and devices. In addition to advantages such as
                speed and the sensitivity, another significant advantage of
                digital production methods is that production data for fillings,
                veneers, bridges, orthodontic plaques, production plaques and
                all other similar applications that are unique to the patient
                can be stored in the database, and they can be produced again
                without the need to take measurement again. Another advantage is
                that the patient’s current oral condition can be scanned and
                recorded, and these recordings can be used to make comparisons
                with new scans. In this way, abrasions, displacements and
                similar changes can be identified.

                Digital surgical guide, which increases the success of implant

                application, which enables reducing surgical traumas,
                3-dimensional tomography is taken to obtained detailed images of
                the jawbone of the patient. Then, an analysis is performed on

              <h2>LASER DENTISTRY</h2>
              <p className="digital-dentistry-description">
                Laser is non-ionizing light and does not accumulate in the
                tissue. For this reason, it does not have any damaging
                properties such as x-ray. It is important to use it in the right
                dose using appropriate laser wavelength. It can be used on
                everyone, including pregnant women, children, and heart
                patients. Disinfection and sterilization are applied in the area
                where the laser is used. The selective property of the laser
                beam, the power of which can be adjusted, on the carious tissue
                ensures that the treatment be completed with minimal loss of
                substance. (Removes only the carious area from the tooth.) In
                surgical applications performed with laser, there is almost no
                bleeding during the procedure. The possibility of complications,
                swelling and discomfort that may occur after each surgical
                application is reduced, and a faster recovery is ensured.

                Nowadays, with advanced three-dimensional tomographic x-rays, we

                about 30 seconds. In this way, both implant applications and
                aesthetic dental treatment applications can be performed
                flawlessly without any taking risks thanks to careful planning.

              <p className="digital-dentistry-description">
                Thanks to digital software, dentists can find the most accurate
                alignment between the patient’s tooth structure, gums, lips and
                face. Thus, a natural and aesthetic smile can be created for a
                person. In digital smile design, a patient-oriented treatment is
                performed. The ideal smile is unique to each individual. That is
                why dentists design the most suitable smile for a person.

              <h2>DIGITAL MEASUREMENT AND SCANNING</h2>
              <p className="digital-dentistry-description">
                Sometimes a gag reflex occurs while taking measurements using
                the classical and traditional system, which leads to problems
                such inability to take precise measurements. Such problems can
                be experienced at a minimum level in the digital measurement
                process. It is possible to make clear implementations by
                transferring the obtained images to virtual environment and
                performing computer modeling. Thanks to digital measurement
                method, the measurement is almost perfect, and discomfort likely
                to be suffered by the patient is greatly reduced. In digital
                dentistry, teeth are scanned with an optical camera, and images
                are transferred to a computer environment in 3 dimensions.
                Measurements are taken using the 3-dimensional scanning method.
