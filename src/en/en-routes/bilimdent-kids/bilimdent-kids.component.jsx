                <p>
                  Pedodontics, in other words, pediatric dentistry, is a branch
                  of dentistry that works to ensure the healthy preservation of
                  both primary and permanent teeth and to eliminate problems
                  caused by decays, trauma, hereditary or similar factors for
                  children between the ages of 0 and 13. Starting from infancy,
                  the monitoring, treatment and preventive measures related to
                  oral-dental health of children and the development of the
                  maxillofacial area constitute the field of study of
                  pedodontics.

                <h3>THE FIRST DENTAL EXAMINATION IN CHILDREN</h3>
                <p>
                  It is recommended that the first dental examination in
                  children be performed by a specialist pediatric dentist after
                  the first primary tooth erupts. In order for the “Fear of
                  Dentists” that we encounter in many adults today not to
                  develop in your child, the time when the first dentist
                  examination is performed and the dentist who performs it are
                  of great importance. Thanks to regular examinations every six
                  months, children's dental development, oral hygiene status and
                  decays that may exist on the teeth can be diagnosed, and
                  carious teeth diagnosed at an early stage can be treated and
                  the risk of caries can be prevented. Examination Process
                  Before the first examination, the family should not inform the
                  children about the procedure. Dentists will give information
                  about the procedure in a way that they can understand. Words
                  such as pain, pain, needle should not be used by families
                  during the first examination, which is performed together with
                  families. Although families expect some procedures to be
                  performed at the first examination, the priority for the
                  doctors should be the children and their psychological
                  condition. First of all, it is necessary to prepare the child.
                  When the child sees that there is nothing to be afraid of,
                  he/she helps with the treatment in cooperation with the
                  doctor. These approaches and treatments should be performed by
                  the most suitable pedodontics specialist (Pediatric Dentist)
                  for your child.

                <h3>TOOTH ERUPTION PERIOD IN INFANTS</h3>
                <p>
                  Deciduous teeth that complete the development process in the
                  bone begin to appear in the mouth by moving towards the face
                  of the gum between the 4th and 7th months. 4. There is a total
                  of 20 deciduous teeth in the mouth at the age of 2.5 - 3. Of
                  these teeth, 10 are in the lower jaw and 10 are in the upper
                  jaw. Tooth eruption process in infants proceeds differently in
                  every baby due to the fact that it is associated with very
                  different factors such as the infant's characteristics,
                  genetic structure, family history and nutritional level. Since
                  the development of each baby is not the same, there are
                  differences in the eruption period.

                In society, deciduous teeth are regarded to be temporary teeth.
                However, it should be remembered that deciduous teeth function
                in the mouth for about 10-12 years and play a very important
                role in the proper development of permanent teeth and protect
                the location of permanent teeth. Deciduous teeth are of great
                importance for eating and making sounds accurately during
                speech. At the same time, it is important for deciduous teeth to
                remain in the mouth until the period of falling off to achieve
                an aesthetic appearance. For this reason, as soon as teeth
                appear in the mouth in infants, it is important to see a dentist
                and maintain oral hygiene in line with the doctor’s
                recommendations.

                <h3>PRIMARY TOOTH TREATMENTS</h3>
                <p>
                  Primary teeth contain more organic matter than normal teeth,
                  so they are more prone to carries and can decay more easily
                  and quickly. Children do not react much in early stages of
                  caries. As the decay progresses, sensitivity to cold and sweet
                  may start. Later, the decayed tooth will cause pain to the
                  child. It is not very easy to put children, especially at a
                  young age, in the dentist's chair and perform treatment.
                  Sometimes even pediatric dentists (pedodontics specialists)
                  cannot perform the treatment of these aching teeth on the
                  couch because the child does not cooperate, and the treatment
                  has to be performed under general anesthesia. Taking into
                  account all these difficulties, great attention should be paid
                  to oral and dental care from the eruption of the first primary
                  teeth. Premature loss of primary teeth causes some problems
                  during permanent dentition, especially in the posterior molar
                  regions because, over time, the neighboring teeth may move
                  towards the cavity where the tooth was lost, causing this
                  place to close. This, in turn, causes the permanent tooth that
                  will be replaced in the future to remain buried or leads to
                  incorrect closures by erupting from a different place. In such
                  cases, it is inevitable that orthodontic treatment (dental
                  brace treatment) be required in the future. If an early
                  primary tooth extraction has to be performed for various
                  reasons, fixed / movable placeholder devices should be made to
                  prevent the place from closing as a result of movements of the
                  teeth next to the extraction cavity.

                <h3>CAUSES OF TOOTH DECAY IN CHILDREN</h3>
                <p>
                  Primary teeth contain more organic matter than permanent
                  teeth, so they are more prone to decay. They decay more
                  easily, and decays can progress very quickly. Children are not
                  able to interpret signals which can be observed in the early
                  period of decays such as cold-hot sensitivity and mild pain in
                  a timely manner. They only realize the situation when there is
                  unbearable pain, in which case it may have been too late.
                  Children cannot pay as much attention to oral care as adults.
                  The child's dexterity, curiosity and the parent's attitude
                  determine the habit of brushing teeth. Teeth should be brushed
                  with parental accompaniment and parental help until children's
                  hand skills develop. Especially at night, teeth can decay more
                  easily because saliva flow will decrease during sleep. For
                  this reason, teeth should be brushed before going to sleep,
                  and nothing other than water should be consumed. A mistake
                  that mothers in particular often make is to put a pacifier or
                  bottle into foods such as candy or jam or get their children
                  used to foods such as sweetened milk and fruit juice between
                  sessions of sleep. These eating habits can cause early
                  childhood decays. Can the formation of decays be prevented? A
                  vaccine or drug that can completely prevent decays has not yet
                  been developed. However, some materials are used today to
                  reduce the number of decays, one of which is the material
                  called "fissure sealant." Dental decays usually begin in the
                  grooves called "fissures" located on the chewing faces of the
                  molars and premolars. By covering the grooves with fissure
                  sealants, decays are prevented by preventing bacteria and
                  nutrient residue from leaking into this area. This procedure
                  can also be applied to permanent molars and premolars that
                  come out from the age of 6. Another way to prevent decays is
                  to increase the resistance of teeth to decays. This resistance
                  is achieved by applying superficial fluoride onto the teeth.

                <p>
                  If the tooth is broken, first of all, you should remain calm
                  so that you don't do anything wrong. If there is bleeding, you
                  should immediately apply compression on the wound site with a
                  clean gauze swab. If there has been an injury to the lip, wash
                  it with cold water and apply compression with gauze. Try to
                  find the broken part. During this time, it is important to
                  keep the area moisturized. Saline, cold milk and even your
                  child's own saliva are ideal for this. Broken tooth fragments
                  should not dry. Otherwise, they cannot be glued. Go to the
                  dentist as soon as possible. These parts will be glued using
                  strong agents (bonding), and they will be aesthetic and
                  durable like any composite filler to be made. If the broken
                  tooth fragment is not found, it is possible to restore the
                  tooth very successfully using composite or ceramic systems,
                  similar to a natural tooth. Even if there is no fracture in
                  oral-dental injuries, it is necessary to take the child to the
                  dentist to monitor the vitality of the tooth. If the tooth
                  that has been traumatized loses its vitality, its color will
                  become darker, and cystic lesions may develop at the root tip.
                  If the tooth has lost its vitality, root canal treatment
                  should be performed. Whether it is required becomes clear
                  within a few months. Nevertheless, the traumatized tooth will
                  be evaluated separately during routine 6-month check-ups.

                <h3>TOOTH DISCOLORING IN CHILDREN</h3>
                <p>
                  Tooth discoloration can have a bad effect on children's social
                  life and psychology and lead to loss of self-confidence. The
                  prominence of visuality and the sensitivity of parents to
                  their children increase the importance of aesthetic treatments
                  for tooth discoloration today. Discolorations on the teeth are
                  generally caused by 3 different reasons; Drug-Induced
                  Discolorations: Nowadays, all infants take iron supplements,
                  and iron medications have side effects such as tooth
                  discoloration. To prevent discoloration, medicines in the form
                  of drops should be dripped directly on the back of the tongue
                  so that the baby can swallow without them touching the teeth.
                  Chromogenic Discolorations: Some bacteria in the mouth
                  (chromogenic bacteria) affect the transparent membrane located
                  on the outside of the teeth, causing discoloration.
                  Discoloration, which affects all teeth in general, can be
                  cleaned with the polishing process but it can happen again. It
                  requires check-up every 6 months. The rate of discolorations
                  decreases with aging. Dental Decays: Dental decays in the
                  initial state can be confused with discoloration, especially
                  on the teeth in the anterior region. Dental appointments are
                  very important for the accurate diagnosis and follow-up.

                <p>
                  Clear aligners for children, as the name implies, is a
                  pediatric treatment method where braces are not used. It is a
                  field where the procedure commonly known as dental correction
                  can also be performed. Clears aligners for children is based
                  on dealing with a number of problems related to the mouth and
                  jaw using plaques. The procedure is also known as transparent
                  plaque treatment. At What Age Is Transparent Plaque Used for
                  Children? It is not possible to determine a single and exact
                  age for all patients because the development, growth, tooth
                  eruption age and dental diseases are different for each
                  individual. However, in order for the plaques to be placed
                  properly, there must be a certain number of teeth in the
                  mouth. In this treatment, the presence of both primary and
                  adult teeth in the mouth does not pose a problem. An
                  orthodontic dentist will determine whether the child is
                  suitable for treatment, the duration of the treatment and the
                  optimal age to start treatment.

                <h3>FISSURE SEALANT AND FLUORINE APPLICATIONS</h3>
                <p>
                  What is a fissure? Indented and cleft-shaped surface of the
                  teeth are called fissures. The developmentally visible pits
                  and grooves on the surface of the teeth are called fissures.
                  What is a fissure sealer? It is the material that covers the
                  indentations and cavities on the tooth surface, that is, the
                  fissures. The application of this procedure is called fissure
                  sealant. A fissure can be defined as a kind of dental vaccine.
                  It is a fairly easy, painless procedure to prevent formation
                  of caries. This application is the most ideal treatment method
                  for children who have a fear of dentists or who go to the
                  dentist for the first time. At what age should the fissure be
                  applied? This application is usually applied to the first
                  molars, which are called 6-year-old teeth, that is, permanent
                  teeth. However, this is not a mandatory condition, and it can
                  also be applied to primary teeth and, again, to small molars
                  in the same way. Another application may be on developmental
                  grooves and cleft-shaped formations on the front or back
                  teeth. These areas are ideal places for food accumulation and
                  caries can easily occur if good oral hygiene is not
                  maintained. In order to be a precaution in such areas, teeth
                  can be protected from caries by applying a fissure sealant to
                  prevent decays on the surfaces. There is no loss of natural
                  tooth tissue in the fissure cover application. After the
                  application, patients are called for routine check-up sessions
                  for 6 months. Over time, the fissure sealants may wear out or
                  disappear. In such cases, fissure closure treatment can be
                  applied again if the physician deems it appropriate. The main
                  goal in this application is to protect molars that decay more
                  easily, especially until the age of 9-10, when children can
                  brush their teeth effectively during the period when their
                  motor functions can be fully implemented.

                <h3>GENERAL ANESTHESIA AND SEDATION</h3>
                <p>
                  It may be required to use general anesthesia and sedation to
                  provide a quality dental treatment when immediate and
                  extensive dental treatment is needed for young children with
                  whom cooperation cannot be achieved, children with mental,
                  physical or medical disabilities and extremely uncooperative,
                  scared, anxious children and adolescents, or those who cannot
                  be communicated. The procedures are performed in operating
                  room conditions with a team of an anesthesiologist, an
                  anesthesia technician, a dentist and his/her assistant. It
                  allows all the procedures in the mouth to be performed in a
                  single session.
