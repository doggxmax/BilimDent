                Yes, the clinic offers All on 4 Implants. These are special
                prosthetics that are created using custom-angled implants and

                possible for patients with complete loss of teeth and when there
                is too much bone resorption. Thanks to temporary fixed
                prosthetics that are applied right after the implant surgery,
                patients can get their teeth in a single session. The final
                confirmation if the treatment can be provided in a single visit
                to Turkey can only be confirmed following the oral examination
                made by the Cosmetic Dentist.
